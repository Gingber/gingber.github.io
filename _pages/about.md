I am an Associate Professor of the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I obtained my Ph.D. Degrees in University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2016. My research interests include social network mining, computational behavior modeling, recommender system, data mining, machine learning and knowledge graph, with an emphasis on designing new algorithms for behavior prediction, recommendation, fraud detection, event detection and security making. For more detailed personal information, please refer to my CV.

I am looking for highly-motivated students to work with me on the exciting area of social network, data mining, machine learning and network security. If you want me to write a recommendation letter for you, please first read this.
